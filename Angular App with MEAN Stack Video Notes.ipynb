    "        1. Node app serves Angular SPA\n",
    "            - node (express) handles incoming requests\n",
    "            - requests targeting \"/\" path returns Angular SPA\n",
    "        2. Two separate servers\n",
    "            - node (express) handles incoming requests\n",
    "            - Angular SPA served from separate static host (doesn't need to be a Node server)\n",
    "    - note: these two methods really only differ at the deployment stage of development\n",
    "    - note: regardless of the method, we will have logically separated apps\n",
    "    \n",
    "33. What is a RESTful API?\n",
    "    - note: REST stands for Representation State Transfer.\n",
    "    - note: a RESTful API is a server side solution/solution/app\n",
    "    - note: RESTful APIs are \"stateless backends\"\n",
    "    - note: RESTful APIs rely on requests to work, and are all \"http verbs\" such as get, post, delete, patch, put.\n",
    "    - note: for example, a post request could be made to the backend database to add a new user account.\n",
    "    - note: JSON data is the preferred format to work with here, though we could be using HTML, XML, or something else entirely.\n"
